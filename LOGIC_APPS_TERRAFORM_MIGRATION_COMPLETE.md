# Logic Apps Terraform Migration - COMPLETE ‚úÖ

## Migration Summary

**Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETE** - All Logic Apps deployment logic has been successfully moved to Terraform

**Date**: June 7, 2025

## What Was Changed

### ‚úÖ Terraform Infrastructure Updates
- **`infra/logic_apps.tf`** - Basic Logic App workflow resources
- **`infra/logic_app_definitions.tf`** - NEW: ARM template deployments for complex workflow definitions
- **`infra/outputs.tf`** - Added workflow deployment outputs and trigger URLs

### ‚úÖ GitHub Actions Workflow Updates
- **`.github/workflows/deploy-infra.yml`** - Fixed YAML formatting and added ARM template imports
- **`.github/workflows/deploy-logicapps.yml`** - ‚ùå **DELETED** (no longer needed)

### ‚úÖ Deployment Scripts Updated
- **`deploy.sh`** - Updated to use Terraform-only approach
- **`deploy.ps1`** - Updated to use Terraform-only approach

## New Architecture

### Before (Hybrid Approach)
```
Terraform ‚Üí Empty Logic Apps
   ‚Üì
GitHub Actions ‚Üí Deploy Workflow Definitions via az CLI
```

### After (Terraform-Only)
```
Terraform ‚Üí ARM Template Deployments ‚Üí Complete Logic Apps with Workflows
```

## Key Technical Changes

1. **ARM Template Integration**: Uses `azurerm_resource_group_template_deployment` resources to deploy complex Logic App workflow JSON files that can't be expressed in native Terraform.

2. **Parameter Management**: Dynamic parameter resolution (AI Foundry endpoints, connection IDs, managed identity) is now handled directly in Terraform locals.

3. **Single Deployment Pipeline**: Eliminated the need for separate GitHub Actions workflow by handling everything in one Terraform infrastructure deployment.

## Files No Longer Needed

The following standalone Logic Apps deployment scripts are now obsolete:
- `deploy-logic-apps.sh` - Parameter processing logic (replaced by Terraform)
- `deploy-logic-apps.ps1` - Parameter processing logic (replaced by Terraform)

These files can be archived or removed as they're no longer part of the deployment process.

## Benefits of New Approach

1. **100% Infrastructure as Code** - All resources managed through Terraform
2. **Simplified Deployment** - Single pipeline instead of hybrid approach
3. **Better Parameter Management** - Dynamic resolution in Terraform
4. **Easier Testing** - All infrastructure changes can be planned/validated
5. **No az CLI Dependencies** - No more shell script parameter processing

## Validation

- ‚úÖ Terraform configuration validates successfully
- ‚úÖ GitHub Actions workflow syntax is correct
- ‚úÖ ARM template deployments configured for all Logic Apps
- ‚úÖ Parameter resolution logic integrated into Terraform

## Next Steps

1. **Test Deployment**: Run a full deployment to validate the new approach
2. **Archive Old Scripts**: Move obsolete deployment scripts to archive folder
3. **Update Documentation**: Update README and deployment guides
4. **Monitor Performance**: Ensure ARM template deployments work as expected
